assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}
myMean(assignment2)

# This code returned an error "Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'someData' not found" 
# This function failed because the variables "assignment" and "someData" are not defined which means that the program can not compute an answer.
# A corrected version of this to determine the mean of the data set would be the following:

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
}
myMean(assignment2)
